# Multi-Model Agent Application

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multi-Model Support**:
  - Large Language Models (LLMs): Gemini, Claude, GPT models
  - Vision Models: Image analysis and recognition

- **Advanced Database Integration**:
  - SQL Database connectivity with intelligent query generation
  - Vector database (Milvus) for semantic similarity search
  - Automatic fallback mechanisms between database types
  
- **Streaming Response Architecture**:
  - Real-time, token-by-token streaming responses
  - Progressive updates during complex operations
  - Asynchronous processing for responsive user experience
  
- **Multi-Function Execution**:
  - Concurrent function calls for complex queries
  - Combined result synthesis from multiple data sources
  - Smart error handling with fallback strategies
  
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**:
  - Context-aware responses backed by database knowledge
  - Citation verification for factual accuracy
  - Robust data retrieval with multiple fallback mechanisms

## üöÄ Technical Capabilities

- **Asynchronous Architecture**: Built on FastAPI with async endpoints for non-blocking operations
- **Streaming Support**: Server-sent events (SSE) for real-time updates
- **Intelligent Function Routing**: Dynamically selects appropriate operation based on query analysis
- **Dual Database Strategy**: SQL for structured data and Milvus for vector embeddings
- **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful degradation when primary data sources are unavailable
- **Citation Validation**: Verifies AI-generated content against source documents
- **Progressive Response Generation**: Streams results as they become available during complex operations
